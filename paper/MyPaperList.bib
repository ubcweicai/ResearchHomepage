ABSTRACT="Blockchain game is the most important category of decentralized
applications. However, to leverage the feature of blockchain in
state-of-the-art game mechanism design is still a challenge for developers
and designers. In this work, we propose an interoperable blockchain gaming
framework across multiple games and chains, to facilitate next-generation
blockchain games. Two demo games are implemented to validate our framework."

ABSTRACT={Edge computing is a novel paradigm designed to improve the quality of
service for latency sensitive cloud applications. However, the
state-of-the-art edge services are designed to specific applications, which
are isolated from each other. To better improve the utilization level of
edge nodes, public resource sharing among edges from distinct service
providers should be encouraged economically. In this work, we employ the
payment channel techniques to design and implement EdgeToll, a
blockchain-based toll collection system for heterogeneous public edge
sharing. Test-bed has been developed to validate the proposal and
preliminary experiments has been conducted to demonstrate the time and cost
efficiency of the system.}

abstract="It has been shown recently that using Mobile Agents (MAs) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can help to achieve the flexibility of over-the-air software deployment on demand. In MA-based WSNs, it is crucial to find out an optimal itinerary for an MA to perform data collection from multiple distributed sensors. However, using a single MA brings up the shortcomings such as large latency, inefficient route, and unbalanced resource (e.g. energy) consumption. Then a novel genetic algorithm based multi-agent itinerary planning (GA-MIP) scheme is proposed to address these drawbacks. The extensive simulation experiments show that GA-MIP performs better than the prior single agent algorithms in terms of the product of delay and energy consumption.",
