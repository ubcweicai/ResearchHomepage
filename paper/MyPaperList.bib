ABSTRACT = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is becoming an increasingly important technology in future networks with the climbing demand for local services. For instance, resource sharing in the D2D network features ubiquitous availability, flexibility, low latency and low cost. However, these features also bring along challenges when building a satisfactory resource sharing system in the D2D network. Specifically, user mobility is one of the top concerns for designing a cooperative D2D computational resource sharing system since mutual communication may not be stably available due to user mobility. A previous endeavour has demonstrated and proven how connectivity can be incorporated into cooperative task scheduling among users in the D2D network to effectively lower average task execution time. There are doubts about whether this type of task scheduling scheme, though effective, presents fairness among users. In other words, it can be unfair for users who contribute many computational resources while receiving little when in need. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based credit system that can be incorporated into the connectivity-aware task scheduling scheme to enforce fairness among users in the D2D network. Users’ computational task cooperation will be recorded on the public blockchain ledger in the system as transactions, and each user’s credit balance can be easily accessible from the ledger. A supernode at the base station is responsible for scheduling cooperative computational tasks based on user mobility and user credit balance. We investigated the performance of the credit system, and simulation results showed that with a minor sacrifice of average task execution time, the level of fairness can obtain a major enhancement.},

abstract="It has been shown recently that using Mobile Agents (MAs) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can help to achieve the flexibility of over-the-air software deployment on demand. In MA-based WSNs, it is crucial to find out an optimal itinerary for an MA to perform data collection from multiple distributed sensors. However, using a single MA brings up the shortcomings such as large latency, inefficient route, and unbalanced resource (e.g. energy) consumption. Then a novel genetic algorithm based multi-agent itinerary planning (GA-MIP) scheme is proposed to address these drawbacks. The extensive simulation experiments show that GA-MIP performs better than the prior single agent algorithms in terms of the product of delay and energy consumption.",
